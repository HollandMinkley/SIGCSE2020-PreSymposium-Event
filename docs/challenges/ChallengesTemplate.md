# Examples

Many liberal arts computing programs operate in an educational culture where all students are welcomed into any major regardless of background (in contrast to large universities where students may need to apply to be accepted to certain Colleges or Majors). Additionally, liberal arts students may be more prone to take courses outside their major as part of their breadth or academic exploration. This can create challenges for introductory courses, particularly in small-school settings where adding multiple variants of the introductory course may not be possible. This discussion will focus on strategies for teaching computing to a class of students with a wide range of backgrounds, ideally challenging the more experienced students while supporting and encouraging the less experienced students.

Hiring and retaining faculty in academic computer science programs is a challenge at all institutions and perhaps particularly at liberal arts institutions. Graduate students may not understand the nature of these positions; for example, they may not know what a liberal arts philosophy entails, that active research takes place at liberal arts institutions, and that teaching loads can vary. This discussion will focus on collecting ideas for how to communicate about the advantages of academic positions at liberal arts institutions and opportunities for collaboration to distribute this information to candidates on or about to enter the job market.
